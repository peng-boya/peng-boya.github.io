I am a fourth-year PhD Candidate in the Department of Decisions, Operations and Technology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Jing WU and Prof. Vernon Ning HSU. My research interests are empirical operations management, supply chain management, and operations-finance interface.
